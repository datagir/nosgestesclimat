    We have chosen to offer you a way of counting the impact of your air travel over several years. The impact on the climate is such that it is important to take this into account.

    So, whether you fly every year or not, answer "yes" and you'll then have the option of entering your flight times over the last 3 years.

    > If you flew from Zurich to New York in 2022 (approximately 19h return), your associated emissions (almost 2 tonnes) will be spread over the last 3 years.

    Around 4 times a year, every Swiss citizen has the opportunity to vote on various issues at federal, cantonal and municipal level.

    Depending on the subject, the votes can be an opportunity to raise the issue of climate change. It's a way of taking indirect action on the carbon footprint of public services, and on other issues where individual efforts are not enough.

    But that's not all! You can take part in citizens' forums or assemblies! If you are a student, there may be processes in place (assemblies, petitions, votes, etc.) to steer your university towards sustainability If you're an employee, can you influence the choices your company makes? If you're retired, can you give some of your time to cooperatives or associations?

    Flying has revolutionised the way we live and travel. We can now travel further, faster and more frequently, but unfortunately this has not come without a downside for the climate. 

    In fact, there is a ratio of 100 between the emission factors (quantity of CO‚ÇÇ emitted per km travelled) of a plane and a train.

    This is why adapting our weekends and holidays by turning to low-carbon mobility offers and/or rethinking the way we travel is essential if we want to reduce our impact on the climate, both individually and as a society

    ## For√ßage radiatif total

    L'avion a un impact important sur le climat √† la fois √† cause de ses √©missions de CO‚ÇÇ et d'autres effets (dit for√ßage radiatif additionnel).

    Du fait que les avions volent en haute altitude, la combustion du k√©ros√®ne cr√©e des tra√Æn√©es et perturbe les cycles d'autres gaz √† effet de serre que le CO‚ÇÇ (vapeur d'eau, eau condens√©e sous diverses formes, NOx et m√©thane qui, ensemble, produisent de l'ozone, etc.).

    ## Avion vs voiture

    Ramen√© au passager, l'impact carbone d'un trajet en avion est dans certains cas du m√™me ordre que celui d'un trajet en voiture. Toutefois, l'empreinte de la voiture elle-m√™me est √©lev√©e. Comparer l'avion √† la voiture ne rend pas ce premier vertueux.

    Deuxi√®mement, un trajet en avion est en g√©n√©ral bien plus long. Quand il s'agit de choisir la destination des vacances par exemple, un trajet en voiture a donc toutes les chances d'√™tre beaucoup moins polluant. Cela dit, notons aussi que nos kilom√©trages en voiture sont tels que le match est relanc√© quand on regarde l'empreinte √† l'ann√©e.

    Eco-driving is a simple and effective action that everyone can take.  It involves a series of recommendations to adopt, such as checking tyre pressure or optimising gear ratios.

    By taking these steps, you can save up to 15% on fuel, cut vehicle maintenance costs, reduce the risk of accidents and make substantial savings that can amount to several hundred Swiss francs. 

    Adopting eco-driving techniques is all the more relevant in towns and urban areas where there are frequent stops and restarts.

    Whenever possible, taking public transport or light forms of transport (walking, cycling, scootering, etc.) to work not only reduces our carbon footprint, but also improves our quality of life.

    In Geneva, 45% of work-related journeys are made by car or motorised two-wheeler ( <a href="https://statistique.ge.ch/domaines/11/11_02/tableaux.asp">MRMT 2021</a>), mostly by people travelling alone in their cars. This is what is known as auto-solism.

    As well as emitting a lot of greenhouse gases, this type of driving reduces the quality of the air in our towns and cities, and therefore our health, clogs up urban roads and creates noise pollution.

    > In the canton of Geneva, for example, traffic jams account for <a href="[Geneva traffic report | TomTom Traffic Index](https://www.tomtom.com/traffic-index/geneva-traffic/">133 lost hours</a> per person per year, or around 6 days.

    The electric scooter is not a miracle solution, but for certain uses it can be a (very) useful way of reducing our carbon footprint.

    However, we must be careful not to come to the simplistic conclusion that simply switching to a fleet of electric vehicles will be enough to reduce the carbon footprint of Geneva's commuters. 

    Priority should be given to walking, cycling or using public transport wherever possible. 

    Nevertheless, the reduction figure presented for this action does correspond to the difference in greenhouse gas emissions that would have occurred if you had travelled your kilometres with an electric vehicle rather than a combustion engine.

    Around 85% of a household's final energy consumption goes on heating and hot water.

    As well as having a significant financial cost, this energy consumption increases the carbon footprint of households.

    However, it can easily be limited by lowering the temperature of occupied rooms without losing thermal comfort or feeling cold.

    For example, set the temperature at between 19¬∞ and 21¬∞C in rooms that are occupied during the day (and 17¬∞C at night or in rooms that are not very busy).

    Lowering the heating temperature by 1¬∞C represents <a href="https://www.ge.ch/document/30986/annexe/0">energy savings of 7% to 10%</a>. This may not seem much on an individual scale, but if everyone takes this action, it is a powerful lever for reducing CO2 emissions.

    Windows should of course be kept closed. To ventilate your home, and if you don't have mechanical ventilation, open the windows wide 1x a day for 5 to 10 minutes a day.

    Good management of blinds and shutters will increase your comfort and further reduce emissions from your home: opening them during the day will allow you to benefit from the sun's energy, while closing them at night will increase your comfort and reduce heat loss.

    > Heat pumps are often referred to as *PAC*.

    üí° Their principle is ingenious: it's an inverted fridge! Using a little electricity, your fridge cools its interior and releases the heat into the room. The heat pump cools the outside air to heat your home.

logement . raccordement r√©seau de chaleur:
  note: |
    A district heating network is a system of pipes used to transport locally produced heat, mainly from renewable and recovered energy sources, to a number of buildings. 

    It is an ecological and economical alternative to gas or oil-fired boilers, for both apartment blocks and offices.

    However, being connected to a heating network is not as simple as taking out an electricity contract. The feasibility of connection depends on <a href=" https://www.ge.ch/installations-chauffage-batiment/se-raccorder-reseau-chauffage-distance">a number of technical conditions</a>.

    First of all, the connection is for an entire building: it is not possible to connect just your flat. Secondly, you need to check that there is a heating network close to the building, and then study the heating infrastructure within the building (a building with a collective heating system will allow you to connect at a lower cost)

    As far as the impact on the climate is concerned, a heating network is generally supplied by local renewable or recovered energy sources (at least 50% in Geneva, with a target of 80% by 2030), i.e. by incinerating household waste, burning biomass or using geothermal energy, which considerably reduces the CO2 impact of the kWh of energy consumed compared with gas or oil.

    Fuelled at least 50% by local renewable and recovered energies (heat from waste incineration, biomass, geothermal energy, etc.), district heating networks are a low-carbon form of heating. 

    District heating is connected to an entire building. It requires the presence of a heating network close to the building, and is easier when the building is already equipped with a collective heating system.

alimentation . manger local:
  description: |
    Local food reduces the transport distances of the products we consume. However, even if this may seem counter-intuitive, local food can, depending on the case, be disadvantageous in terms of greenhouse gas emissions: the impact of the origin of our products cannot be summed up by a comparison between short and long distances. The effects of scale, the centralisation of products, the efficiency of the transport used (or conversely the lack of efficiency) make the matter more complex from a carbon accounting point of view.

    Nevertheless, local food has many other positive impacts, such as supporting farmers in our regions! 

    In Geneva, the "Gen√®ve R√©gion Terre Avenir" (GRTA) label identifies products from local agriculture. The https://www.geneveterroir.ch/fr/marque-de-garantie-grta-info/2443 website lists the canton's GRTA producers.

    Contrary to what one might imagine, the impact of this action is relatively small, as the proportion of seasonal products in the average Swiss diet is very low.

    But there are many other benefits to seasonal eating, such as lower water consumption, greater crop diversity, and less dependence on hydrocarbons (gas and oil) to heat greenhouses. What's more, the body doesn't need the same nutrients all year round, and these needs correspond to seasonal foods.

Energy, water, financial and human resources were needed to produce this food, so these resources are also wasted. What's more, they also have an impact on the environment. 

    Reducing food waste is therefore essential if we are to avoid producing to throw away, save resources and reduce our impact on the environment!
